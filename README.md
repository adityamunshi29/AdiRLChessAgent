### Learning to play chess through model-based RL
#### Aditya Munshi

This is a work in progress, a chess engine that can play against other computational agents and humans. Nowadays I am training newer models and improving performance gradually. Self play mechanisms may be introduced.

Many thanks to RLC Chess for providing an existing basis framework to build upon. Over time, I plan to completely refactor the code and build my own environment.

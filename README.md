## Learning chess through model-based Deep Reinforcement Learning
#### Aditya Munshi

This is a work in progress, a chess engine that can play against other computational agents and humans. Nowadays I am training newer models and improving performance gradually. Attention networks as well as LSTMs may be built in to boost performance.

Many thanks to RLC Chess for providing an existing basis framework to build upon. Over time, I plan to completely refactor the code and build my own environment.
